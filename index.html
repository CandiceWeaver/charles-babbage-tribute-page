          <h2>About Charles Babbage</h2>
          <p>Babbage was a British mathematician, and is credited with the invention of the first computer. He was born on 26<sup>th</sup> December 1791 and was educated at home until he studied mathematics at Cambridge University in 1810</p>
          <p>Within two years of working for the Royal Institution, Babbage was elected as a member of the Royal Society. He also played an important role in setting up the Astronomical Society 1820, which challenged the power of the Royal Society. Between 1828 and 1839, Babbage worked as a Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University.</p>
          <p>He invented his Difference Engine in the 1820s. This was a machine that could perform mathematical calculations. He then worked on a bigger and better version of the machine, called the Difference Engine 2. After this, Babbage worked on another machine, which was the device that cemented his fame as a computer pioneer. This was called the Analytical Engine. It had the ability to perform any arithmetic calculation by using punch cards that gave the computer instructions. In addition to this, it also had a memory unit to store numbers and other functional components. Unfortunately, neither the Analytical Engine or the Difference Engine 2 were completed during Babbage's lifetime.</p>
          <p>During his life, he also had intersts in the fields of philosophy and code-breaking, and worked to campaign for the reform of British science. He died on 18<sup>th</sup> October 1871.</p>
